# vue-image-search

## About
A simple VueJS image search app. Created as a refresher on Vue syntax that I can refer back to any time.

Uses ContextualWebSearch API as image searching tool.

## Project setup
Install NPM dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Grab a free [API key](https://rapidapi.com/contextualwebsearch/api/web-search?endpoint=5b864ca4e4b085e3f407ecca) from RapidAPI, create a config.json file at the project root, and add your key.

config.json:
```
{
    "API_KEY": <API_KEY_HERE>
}
```

### Run development server (default: `localhost:8080`)
```
npm run serve
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
